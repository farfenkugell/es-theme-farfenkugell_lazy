# es-theme-farfenkugell_lazy
Small'ish emulation station theme that has only system logos and overlay. <br>
Writted on top of https://github.com/Jetup13/es-theme-base-text <br>
Grid view idea "borrowed" and customized from https://github.com/20GotoTen/es-theme-retrofix <br>
 <br>
Features:
- No system art, image is taken from scrapped games art. Thus you must scrape art in order to see it.
- ~50MB in size with ~130 systems supported (easyrpg, alg, wolf etc)
- If system has no art, it will show a black screen in there. Still wondering how to get around it
- Tested on OGA/RGB10 and OGS
